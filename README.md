# Vulkan Water Renderer

![](screenshots/screenshot.gif)

WIP water rendering using periodic functions and Fractional Brownian Motion.

I'm basing this project in [chapter 1 of GPU Gems](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems/contributors) where they explain a common real time water rendering approach.

It currently uses environment maps for reflections and bling-phong model for illumination.
