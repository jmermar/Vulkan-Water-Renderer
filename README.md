# Vulkan Init Project

This is just a bunch of boilerplate code to get Vulkan Working with bindless descriptor sets.

I've done this in order to bootstrap my personal projects with vulkan, as I always ended copying the same boilerplate code. I don't recommend using this for your projects as it is not a mature or well designed software.
